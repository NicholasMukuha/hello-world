Hello World!!


Did you know that the world is the only planet that supports life? 
As a programmer, you can make this life easier by writing code that makes machines work, while humans sit, relax and enjoy.

That is why, I Nicholas Mukuha consciously made a choice to become a programmer. I know 
1. HTML 
2.CSS 
3.Javascript
4.SASS
5.React
6.Redux and I can write all that and house it in
7.Bootstrap. 

I think, it's time to conquer the world.
